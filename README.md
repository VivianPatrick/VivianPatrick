 👋 Hi, I’m Vivian Nzekwe from Nigeria.
 I’m interested in Software development and anything Tech. I also a strong advocate for women in Tech.
 I’m currently learning Software Engineering at the ALX.
 I’m looking forward to collaborating with other people in the same field that are ahead of me. 
My dream is to one day work with either Google or Microsoft ☺️.
